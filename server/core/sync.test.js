Google is committed to providing economic relief and supporting the pandemic recovery efforts, which is why we’re working to provide accurate vaccine information and increasing vaccine access to people <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/our-commitment-covid-19-vaccine-equity/">around the world</a>, with a particular focus on <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/supporting-india-during-current-covid-crisis/">countries</a> that are continuing to experience the pandemic most intensely.</p><p>We’ve also been focused on how our products can help make things easier for people during this difficult time. Last year, we revamped our roadmap with simple, helpful solutions like <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/local-inventory-ads-curbside-pickup/">curbside pickup for Local Inventory Ads</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/helping-businesses-and-nonprofits-recover/">booking services directly in Search results through Local Services Ads</a>. In 2021 we’re continuing to fine-tune our products to help advertisers connect with consumers even as the world around us keeps changing.</p><p></p><p>Join us today at <a href="https://adsonair.withgoogle.com/events/google-marketing-live-2021?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=keyword&amp;utm_campaign=20210527US">Google Marketing Livestream 2021</a> at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET to learn more — including a deep dive into our latest innovations across privacy, measurement and automation.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Developing privacy-safe advertising technology</h3><p>Time spent with digital media increased 15% last year, according to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-time-spent-with-media-2021-update">eMarketer</a>, as people turned to devices like smartphones, connected TVs and computers. As they use digital tools to manage more aspects of their lives, people want to know that their privacy is protected and we expect these concerns will only increase in the future.</p><p>A healthy ads ecosystem is critical to keeping the internet open and accessible for everyone, but we must also ensure that people feel safe when they are online. Now is the time for our industry to rethink our practices and take bold action to regain people’s trust. That’s a key reason why we <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">announced earlier this year</a> that we won’t build alternate identifiers once third-party cookies are phased out. </p><p>The good news is that it’s possible to improve privacy while still delivering business results. We’re collaborating with the web community to build solutions like those in the <a href="http://privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a>. It’s an open-source initiative to develop new technologies centered on privacy techniques like anonymization, aggregation and on-device processing designed to support key advertising use cases such as interest-based ads, measurement and more.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Navigating new measurement and<br/>audience strategies</h3><p>Accurate measurement of your marketing is especially critical so that you know where to invest to drive the most impact. But the tools advertisers have historically relied on to measure results — such as cookies and other identifiers — are rapidly changing. We\'re focused on ensuring privacy-safe measurement is accessible to businesses and brands of all sizes. </p><p>We\'re investing across our products to help unlock insights into consumer behavior and purchasing decisions using machine learning. For example, we’ll soon be including Display and YouTube, as well as in-app conversions, in all Google Ads attribution models, including <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6394265">data-driven attribution</a> powered by Google’s machine learning. These changes will help you properly value the impact of all your Google Ads campaigns.</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/future-proof-measurement-privacy-safe-solutions/">recently shared</a> how we\'re making it possible for you to use your consented first-party data to preserve accurate measurement, even when fewer cookies are available. First-party data can also help you connect with more of the right people for your business. We\'re now expanding the availability of <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6379332">Customer Match</a> to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6299717">nearly all advertisers</a> to reach and re-engage customers across ad types. As we look to the future, you can expect to see more innovations like these to help with your transition to a privacy-first world.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Improving automation with better performance</h3><p>As the recovery continues, advertisers can automatically tap new pockets of growth by using products that dynamically respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Today, advertisers are applying automation to more aspects of their campaigns than ever before — from automatically assembling and selecting the best-performing creatives with <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7684791">responsive search ads</a>, to finding more search queries that perform using <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529">broad match keywords</a>, and setting the right bid for every auction by factoring in a wide range of signals that predict performance using <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882">Smart Bidding</a>. In fact, we’ve seen that automation products are even better together. For example, companies that switch from phrase match keywords to broad match keywords in campaigns that use <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6268632">Target CPA bidding</a> see 25% more conversions.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "><img alt="Text says: Broad match finds new, high-performing queries and emerging trends. Smart Bidding delivers the right creative for each query at the right price. Responsive search ads automatically assembles the most relevant creative" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_5.51.43_PM.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text"><p>Combining our automated products creates a multiplicative effect for driving growth — starting with keywords, bidding, and creative</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Since automation is delivering strong results for advertisers, we want to help you use it in more places. Today more than 80% of advertisers use automated bidding to take the guesswork out of setting bids and to achieve their performance goals. For example, advertisers who want to optimize their campaigns based on return on ad spend use <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6268637">Target Return on Ad Spend (Target ROAS)</a> Smart Bidding strategies to automatically optimize bids and maximize revenue. Now we’re expanding Target ROAS to work across even more of Google’s channels, including <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9176876">Discovery ads</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10147229">Video action campaigns</a>.</p><p>Just like with automation, you get more efficiency and better results when our advertising tools work together. So we\'ve made it easy for retailers to connect your <a href="https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/merchant-center/">Google Merchant Center</a> feed to Discovery ads and Video action campaigns. This will help you use images and video to drive product discovery and purchases for your full product catalog. In March, when we compared more than 900 Video action campaigns, we found advertisers that added product feeds drove 60% more conversions at a lower cost, compared to advertisers that didn\'t add product feeds.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="Demonstration of a product feed added to Video action campaigns" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Balm_NoPrices_UI_Pixel5_1.gif"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text"><p> Product feed added to Video action campaigns</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Bringing the full value of automation to more advertisers </h3><p>Last year <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/advertising-week-announcements/">we shared</a> that we were testing a new type of campaign called Performance Max. It brings together the best of Google’s automation to help advertisers drive better results across all of Google’s channels: YouTube, Display, Search, Discover and more. Starting today, Performance Max campaigns are expanding to thousands of additional advertisers, with general availability coming later this year (visit the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10724817">Google Ads Help Center</a> for more details and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbVBdafHETNdthecbM5KMuejzPA_WerpVPqxrQXChxNaJIqw/viewform?usp=sf_link">complete this interest form</a> if you’d like to join the beta).</p><p>We’re also adding support for Performance Max campaigns on the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10256472">Insights page</a>. We heard beta testers tell us they wanted more transparency into how automation is working and what’s driving performance changes. With this update, you’ll be able to see things like which audiences are converting, top-performing creatives, auction insights and trending search categories. You can also preview how your best ads are showing up on each channel.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "><img alt="Screenshot of Insights Page in Google Ads" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Top_assets_card.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text"><p>Insights page showing “Top assets” for Performance Max campaigns<br/></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph_with_image"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap"><div class="uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3" data-component="uni-article-paragraph"><figure class="article-image--wrap-small "><img alt="vodafone logo" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Vodafone_logo_pmax_case_study_sm1_copy.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure><div class="rich-text"><p>We’ve seen great results during early beta testing. <a href="https://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone</a> Turkey, part of the Vodafone Group, a leading telecommunications company in Europe and Africa, adopted Performance Max with the goal of scaling lead generation for its phone plans across all of Google’s channels to reach more potential customers.
